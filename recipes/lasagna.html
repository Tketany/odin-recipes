        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic and delectable Italian dish that embodies layers of culinary perfection. This savory and comforting masterpiece is constructed with wide sheets of pasta, meticulously layered with a rich and hearty combination of ingredients. The foundation typically consists of alternating strata of pasta sheets, velvety ricotta cheese, robust marinara sauce, and perfectly seasoned ground meat, often a flavorful blend of beef and pork. Each layer contributes its distinct texture and taste, creating a harmonious symphony of flavors that meld together during the baking process. A generous topping of melted mozzarella and Parmesan cheese crowns the dish, forming a golden, bubbly crust that adds a delightful crunch. Whether served as a centerpiece for family gatherings or intimate dinners, lasagna stands as a timeless embodiment of culinary craftsmanship, capable of satisfying the most discerning palates with its rich, savory, and utterly satisfying profile
