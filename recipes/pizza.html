        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Pepperoni pizza is a classic and universally beloved dish that tantalizes the taste buds with its delicious combination of flavors and textures. At its core, this pizza features a thin or thick crust, depending on regional variations, that serves as the perfect canvas for a symphony of mouthwatering ingredients. The star of the show is the generous layer of thinly sliced pepperoni, a cured and seasoned Italian-American sausage, which delivers a robust and slightly spicy kick.
            Beneath the savory pepperoni, a rich tomato sauce is spread, infusing each bite with the vibrant essence of ripe tomatoes and a harmonious blend of herbs and spices. A blanket of melted mozzarella cheese crowns the pizza, offering a gooey, stretchy texture and a creamy, slightly tangy flavor that complements the other components.
            The interplay of these elements creates a delectable experience that satisfies the palate with a perfect balance of savory, tangy, and salty notes. Whether enjoyed as a quick snack, shared at a gathering, or savored as a comforting meal, pepperoni pizza has become a timeless favorite, capturing the essence of indulgence and culinary satisfaction.

           <h4><em>Pizza Dough:</em></h4>
        <ol>
           <li>
            In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.
           </li>
           <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
           </li>
           <li>
            Mix the ingredients together until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
           </li>
           <li>
            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.
           </li>
        </ol>

           <h4><em>Pizza Sauce:</em></h4>
        <ol>
           <li>In a saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
           <li>Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4><em>Assembling and Baking:</em></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to the temperature recommended for your pizza dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, and arrange pepperoni slices (and any additional toppings) on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and enjoy your homemade pepperoni pizza!
